# AIS Cloudflared

Cloudflared connects your Home Assistant Instance via a secure tunnel via Cloudflare
to a subdomain at ``paczka.pro`` host. This allows you to expose your Home Assistant instance
to the Internet without opening ports on your router.

## Local tunnel add-on setup

### 1. Configure the http integration in your Home Assistant config

Since Home Assistant blocks requests from proxies/reverse proxies, you need to tell your instance to allow requests from the Cloudflared add-on. The add-on runs locally, so HA has to trust the docker network. In order to do so, add the following lines to your /config/configuration.yaml:

Note: There is no need to adapt anything in these lines since the IP range of the docker network is always the same.

``` yaml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    - 172.30.33.0/24
```

#### 2. Set subdomain and password

In the configuration, enter the name of the subdomain under which you want yours Home Assistant instance
to be available. In addition, enter the password that you will reserve for yourself
own subdomain - only the person who knows this password can run the tunnel with this subdomain.

Save your configuration.

#### 3. Start the `AIS Cloudflared` add-on and watch the logs

From the logs you will find out if the subdomain you selected was available and whether the tunnel
has been started correctly.

#### 4. Access your Home Assistant via the remote URL without port

e.g.:

``` yaml
https://my-ha.paczka.pro/
```
